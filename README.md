# Algo-Maze: Maze Visualization Tool

[**View the Demo**](https://algo-mazes.netlify.app)

## Overview

The Maze Visualization Tool is an interactive web application that allows users to create, explore, and visualize various pathfinding algorithms on dynamically generated mazes. This tool is designed to be educational, providing insights into how different algorithms work in finding the shortest path through a maze.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Generate mazes using different algorithms.
- **Start/Goal Node Interaction**: Easily change the start or goal node by clicking or dragging nodes.
- **Algorithm Visualization**: Visualize popular algorithms like BFS, and DFS
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for use on both desktop and Ipad devices (not supported on phoned).
- **Customizable Grid**: Adjust the grid size and maze complexity to explore various scenarios.

### Interacting with the Maze

- **Change Start/Goal Nodes**: Click on the start or goal node, then click on the desired location to swap it. You can also drag the start or goal node to a new position.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose an algorithm from the dropdown menu and watch it in action as it finds the shortest path in the maze.

### Supported Algorithms

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
